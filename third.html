		<h1>Who is my favorite character in friends?</h1>
			<p> 
			

			My favorite character is Chandler Bing. This might sound a little cocky, but I am quite funny. Chandler has a hard life growing up, which is why he makes so many jokes, he hates the holidays, and honestly, he seems really depressed. He did at one-point smoke in the show, and a lot in real life as well, but he also used comedy as an outlet. In the show he said, he makes jokes when he is uncomfortable. You could always count on chandler to lighten the mood, no matter how serious it is. No one else makes jokes like him, well except phoebe, but she is very sarcastic. Chandler and Monica settled down together and honestly, they seem so happy. Just look at them. I don’t know exactly what it is about Chandler Bing, but he is my favorite character in the show.</p>
