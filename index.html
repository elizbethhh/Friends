		<h1>Why I love Friends </h1>
		<div> 
			<p>In friends there are 6 main characters; Rachel Green, Monica Geller, Ross Geller, Chandler Bing, Phoebe Buffay, and Joey Tribbiani. The whole show revolves around Rachel. There were so many topics covered in friends; Phoebe was homeless and had no parents growing up, Chalder’s dad turned out the be trans and his parents fight a lot, Racheal ran from a marriage he wasn’t happy with and struggled to find a job, Joey had so much trouble getting his acting career started and never had enough food, Monica struggled to find someone to settle down with and lost her job, and Ross. Ross’s wife turned out to be lesbian, and then found out his lesbian wife was pregnant with his child, so many issues with his love Racheal, got married and divorced to Emily in a very short period of time, had a daughter with Racheal, married and divorced to Racheal, falling back in love with Rachel.. just so many problems with Racheal. Unfortunately, Rachel is not my favorite character. They covered so many topics in this show, especially on dating and even safe sex, which is amazing. I love this show a lot.
